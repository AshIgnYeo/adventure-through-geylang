# Lorong 14 Geylang

Research and implementation from **17 October 2026**, under open question 51. This brief covers `src/lorong-14-layout.mjs`.

## Scope and method

- **Stretch:** Lorong 14 from Geylang Road south, past Talma Road's east end, to the south edge of the retained extract (about 1.3108 N), with the corners at both ends of both sides and at Talma Road. Talma Road's east mouth is kept as road surface. The Talma Road row and the far side of Geylang Road wait for a later pass.
- **Beyond the extract:** the lane runs on about 100 m to Guillemard Road. The walk stops at the last buildings the extract holds, No. 37 on the east side and Wing Fong Mansions on the west. Extending the extract is [open question 52](open-questions.md).
- **Block faces:** the Geylang Road faces back to Lorong 12 are already in the map. To balance the work of the three lanes mapped at the same time (Lorong 14, 16 and 18), the Geylang Road row is taken east to Lorong 16 instead: Nos. 292–308, between the east corner block (Nos. 284–290) and Lorong 16's west corner. No. 310 belongs to the Lorong 16 walk.
- **The west corner on Geylang Road:** a lawn under large trees, with a litter bin, parked bicycles and steps down to the back lane, as the June 2024 drives and the satellite agree. There is no building to model, and no source outline is missing.
- **Map:** `scripts/prepare-map.mjs` takes the lane's buildings and its thirteen road ways by id, with Talma Road's east mouth. The study rectangle is unchanged.
  - The lane is a walkable corridor (`corridors` in `map.json`). Its mouth shares Lorong 17's node on the Geylang Road centreline, inside the Geylang Road corridors.
  - The fronts of Nos. 284–300 stand inside the Geylang Road corridors. Nos. 302–308 stand about 7 m further back, beyond them, so their forecourt is a corridor of its own, 3 m in front of their faces.
- **Order:** south down the west side from Geylang Road, then north up the east side back to Geylang Road, then east along Geylang Road from No. 292 to No. 308. Each stop is one photographed building, measured and modelled before the next.
- **Imagery:** the June 2024 Lorong 14 drive, southbound, from `3MIt…` at the Geylang Road end to `15hk…` at the extract's edge, about 10 m apart, with the Geylang Road and Talma Road drives at the corners. It is the latest drive along the lane.
- **Naming:** unchanged. A business is named only when Google Maps lists it at that address and its sign shows in the photograph. Other buildings are labelled by address, with their signboards drawn and their lettering blank.
- **Code:** each place is a measured elevation on one edge of its footprint, built with the lane-house helpers shared with Lorong 17, Lorong 19 and Lorong 21 (`src/lane-house-layout.mjs`, `src/lane-house.ts`).

## The lane

- **West side:** the lawn at the Geylang Road corner; Wing Fong Court, an eight-storey block behind a fenced garden of palms; Talma Road; and Wing Fong Mansions, another eight-storey block, running on past the extract's edge.
- **East side:** the corner block of shophouses on Geylang Road; a back lane; The Amazing Inn; Central Imperial, a condominium of curved balconies; the ibis budget hotel; and a row of two- and three-storey houses from No. 25 to No. 37.
- **Geylang Road, east to Lorong 16:** two-storey shophouses from No. 292 to No. 300, then a four-storey block set back behind a forecourt, from No. 302 to No. 308.

The names in the table are those Google Maps gives for each address, or the source map's house numbers where no listing gives one. Whether a building is named in the model is decided at its stop.
